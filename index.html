<p class="par">This website was built to make attendance tracking easier and more transparent for students. Most colleges expect you to maintain at least 75% attendance, but keeping track mentally can be confusing, especially with multiple subjects and unexpected absences. With this tool, you can instantly know where you stand, how much buffer you have, and what adjustments you might need to make. It helps you stay motivated and accountable, while also reducing the chances of getting caught off guard during exam season. Share it with your friends — a little awareness can save a lot of stress later.</p>
